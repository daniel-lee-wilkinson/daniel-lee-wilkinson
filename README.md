I'm a backend-focused data and analytics engineer with a strong foundation in sustainability, automation, and data transformation. I design robust pipelines for sensor and mobility data, build analytics logic with dbt and Snowflake, and generate reproducible reports for emissions tracking and operational insight. My work bridges climate, transport, and industrial systems - combining reliable engineering with meaningful domain insight.


**Current Focus:**  
- Completing IBM Data Engineering Certificate  
- Finalising dbt + Snowflake project-based course  
- Expanding streaming architecture skills (Kafka, Airflow)
