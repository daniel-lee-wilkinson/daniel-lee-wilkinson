## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my project portfolio.

I'm a Data Engineer and Sustainability Analyst specialising in automation, emissions tracking, and decision-support tools.

My projects include end-to-end data pipelines, KPI report generators, internal dashboards, and custom apps - built using Python, SQL, Streamlit, Dash, and SQLite.

This page showcases a mix of public and internal work. Where source code isn't available, summaries explain structure, logic, and impact.

Each project entry includes a short description and badges for the main technologies used. If you're interested in a project or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out.
