## Hi there üëã

Welcome to my project portfolio.

I'm a data engineer and sustainability analyst with a focus on automation, reporting pipelines, and meaningful tools for decision-making. This page showcases a selection of my work - from data ingestion pipelines and emissions tracking tools to custom calculators and internal apps. Some projects are live on GitHub and others are internal or private due to company data or prototype status.

Each project entry includes a short description and badges for the main technologies used. If you're interested in a project or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out.
