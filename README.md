I'm a backend-focused data and analytics engineer working at the intersection of sustainability, automation, and analysis. My experience spans automated pipelines for sensor and mobility data, emissions tracking, dbt/Snowflake transformation logic, and reproducible reporting. I bring domain depth in climate, energy, and transport systems - combining reliable engineering with practical insight generation.


**Current Focus:**  
- Completing IBM Data Engineering Certificate  
- Finalising dbt + Snowflake project-based course  
- Expanding streaming architecture skills (Kafka, Airflow)
